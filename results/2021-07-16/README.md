* Single-cell RNA-seq of CD45- cells from mouse popliteal lymph nodes 8 hrs after infection with Chikungunya virus.
* Libraries from 2021-04-16 were enriched for molecules aligning to the CHIKV genome using a library resampling approach described [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1204).
* This run includes all mock- and CHIKV-infected samples from the experiment.
